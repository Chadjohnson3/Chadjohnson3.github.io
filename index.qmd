## Chad Johnson

*Graduate Student | Data Science | Sports Fan | Lifelong Learner*

Welcome! I'm Chad Johnson, a graduate student studying Data Science with a background in accounting. I love learning new things, solving problems, and finding meaningful ways to apply data-driven insights to real-world challenges.

### A Bit About Me

I’ve always been curious about numbers and patterns, which led me to study accounting during my undergrad. Now, as I pursue my Master's in Data Science, I’m excited to combine my business knowledge with powerful analytical tools to make an impact in the field.

Beyond academics, I enjoy teaching and mentoring others. In my free time, you’ll find me running, playing pickleball, or following major sports like college football, the NFL, MLB, and college basketball.

### What I’m Working On

- **Expanding My Data Science Portfolio:** I’m building projects focused on visualization, predictive modeling, and automation.
- **BookVista Bookkeeping:** I run a small business on the side helping service-based industries manage their financial operations.
- **Exploring New Opportunities:** I’m seeking ways to apply my skills in data science to meaningful, real-world applications.
